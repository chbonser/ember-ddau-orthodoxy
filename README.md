# Ember Data Down Actions Up Orthodoxy

This is a toy Ember.js app build to explore the 'Data Down, Actions Up'
paradigm for managing state in an Ember application.

This app and the tags are custom built for a talk at the [May 25, 2017 Ember ATX
Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Ember-ATX/events/239569396/).
